# <Web APIs Challenge: Code Quiz>

## Description

As you proceed in your journey to becoming a full-stack web developer, it’s likely that you’ll be asked to complete a coding assessment, perhaps as part of an interview process. A typical coding assessment is a combination of multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges.

To help you become familiar with these tests and give you a chance to apply the skills from this module, this week’s Challenge invites you to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. This week’s coursework will teach you all the skills you need to succeed in this assignment.


## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
